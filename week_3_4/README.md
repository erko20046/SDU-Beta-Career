# Talend ETL Jobs

## What is a Talend Job?

A **Talend Job** is an executable ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflow created in the **Talend Studio**.  
Each job is designed to move and transform data from one system to another in a structured, reusable, and automated way.

### Key Features:
- **Extract**: Read data from various sources (databases, APIs, files, cloud storage).
- **Transform**: Clean, filter, join, aggregate, or apply business rules to the data.
- **Load**: Write the transformed data into target systems (databases, data warehouses, data lakes).

## Why use Talend Jobs?
- **Reusable**: Jobs can be modular and reused across projects.  
- **Visual design**: No need to code everything manually, components like `tMap`, `tInput`, and `tOutput` simplify ETL pipelines.  
- **Scalable**: Supports large data volumes and parallel processing.  
- **Integration**: Works with most common data sources — SQL/NoSQL databases, APIs, flat files, and cloud services.

## Example Workflow
1. Extract product data from a development database.  
2. Transform it — apply mappings, filters, and normalization rules.  
3. Load it into a production database, updating existing records instead of inserting duplicates.

## Typical Components
- **tInput**: Reads data from a source (DB, file, API).  
- **tMap**: Applies transformations and mapping logic.  
- **tOutput**: Writes data to a target system.  
- **tLogRow**: Debugging and previewing data flows.

## Summary
Talend Jobs make it easier to build **production-ready ETL pipelines** with clear logic, error handling, and maintainability.  
They help ensure data consistency, especially when applying normalization rules like **3rd Normal Form (3NF)**, and are widely used for integrating enterprise systems.
